:gf:awkward: I cannot believe that this is happening right nowâ€¦
:dad:smug: I finally get to meet the one who stole my daughterâ€™s heart. What an honor.
:bf:smug: Skap!
:dad:smug: Oh, thatâ€™s a language you donâ€™t usually hear nowadays! Shaya, does he speak English? 
:gf:awkward: Yeah, but not the best. Heâ€™s South Korean, and heâ€™s taught me a lot of the other language that he speaks. So I can understand him.
:dad:angry: Oooohâ€¦ teaching my daughter something valuable! At least youâ€™ll be a bit helpful when you die tonight.
:gf:angry: DAD.
:dad:smug: Ok ok Shaya, I know you care for this boy. So just for you Iâ€™ll make a little deal. Your boyfriend and I will do a little musical battle in front of this crowd.
:dad:smug: If he wins, Iâ€™ll let him date you for the time being. If he loses, then I make him my rug. Deal?
:gf:reallysmug: Heh. Youâ€™ll regret that decision! Bartholomew is the best rapper AND singer I know! Heâ€™ll show you!
:bf:smug: Yeah!
:dad:angrysmile: Ha. Then letâ€™s begin.
