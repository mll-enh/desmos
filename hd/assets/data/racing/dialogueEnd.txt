:super-sonic:reassure:Hey kid, I don't know if you can hear me...but I think you should stick to rapping.
:super-sonic:default:Being me isn't easy. Being ANYONE who isn't you is difficult.
:super-sonic:default:There's nothing wrong with wanting to do more for others.
:super-sonic:default:However, it's okay to accept that you won't always be able to do more for others, too.
:super-sonic:reassure:You can still be strong and help others without being super fast or physically built.
:super-sonic:reassure:I don't know anything about you, but I bet the people in your life already see you as strong enough.
:super-sonic:reassure:Someday in the near future, you'll be able to up your limits. This is too early though!
:super-sonic:default:I gotta head out now, but I'm proud of you for coming this far. Let me grab some rings to patch you right...
