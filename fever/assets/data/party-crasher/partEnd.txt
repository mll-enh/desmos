:fuckoff:
:yukichismile: You types are always so resilient.
:defrown: You "types?" What's that supposed to mean?
:yukichismile: Shut up, scumbag! If I have to use some more power to achieve my goal, then I will! After that, things will get a lot more peaceful!
:defrown: Here we go.
:pepperdemonsad: Hey dad, what's going on?
:defrown: Huh? Pepper, you need to leave.
:pepperdemonsad: ...
:yukichinormal: Did that pepper just call you dad?
:teaneutral: It's a long story.
:defrown: Huh? No it isn-
:teaannoytwo: No, it is, isn't it Fever? A long, tragic story.
:teaannoytwo: One where if you were to leave, that'd make Pepper here an orphan again. 
:defrown: ...
:defrown: Oh, yeah. I mean, I suppose if you have to take me in, you might as well do it now.
:yukichinormal: ...
:teathink: Of course, we'll miss you as you go back to space jail... but I guess we'll just have to live on without you...
:desmile: It's a shame, but I guess such is the fate of the cruel, mean space police.
:yukichinormal: You guys think you're so funny, don't you...
:yukichinormal: ...
:yukichismile: Ugh, fine. I'll let you go for now. Only cause I don't wanna make a scene.
:yukichismile: But watch yourself Fever, your days of being free are almost up.
:narrator: ...
:defrown: Ugh.
:defrown: That was super uncomfortable.
:teaannoy: You know what else is going to be uncomfortable in just a second?
:defrown: Okay, okay- I get it, I didn't tell you enough, I'm sorry.
:desmile: But for now, let's just enjoy the night before it leaves.
:desmile: Hey pepper, stick around with us for a bit. We'll buy you a burger or something.
:pepperdemonsmile: Oh really? Thank you, dad!
:pepperdemonsmile:
:pepperdemonsmile: What's a burger?
