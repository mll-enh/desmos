:teaneutral: So.
:casualconfuse: What?
:teaneutral: Is there any reason why we're in the melon patch, of all places?
:casualtired: Oh y'know, I'm just hungry.
:teaannoy: That's a lie.
:casualtired: Huh? I've not one to lie! I mean-
:teaannoy: We've been walking through this melon patch for like, ten minutes.
:teaannoy: You could've easily picked the first few we've seen.
:teatwo: But you decided to keep walking, and continuously change discussion topics. So lemme ask again-
:teatwo: What's the reason for bringing us here, Fever?
:casualworry: ...
:casualworry:Okay, so maybe I'm a bit tired.
:teatwo: How does that make any-
:casualworry: I just, needed to go somewhere we wouldn't be harassed, or attacked by loud-mouthed nuns.
:teasmile: Aww. I get it, babe.
:casualtired: Bruh like- you wouldn't imagine the fucking week I had.
:teaneutral: Two weeks, actually.
:casualsilly: Oh yeah, right. You were there. Looking all cute and shit.
:teaannoy: Bruh. Here comes the compliments.
:casualflirt: It's true! You're super cute! Hot, even!
:teablush: Ugh, no you~.
:casualannoyed: Okayyy, we're not doing this.
:narrator: . . .
:casualsilly: Though, now that we're pretty far from town, there IS something that we could do...
:teablush: Oh yeah?
:casualflirt: No one's here to bother us...
:casualtired: Pendejos...
:casualsilly: Now~.
:casualsilly: How about we-

:makoangry: Yo! Down here!
:makoangry: Also I'm AUSTRALIAN, not bri'ish!
:casualscared: Is that a fucking talking melon?
:teaannoy: British? Australian??
:makohappy: Yeah! This is where I live. The hell were you guys about to do in front of me and my mates?
:casualsilly: Probably make out. I dunno, depends on how long we were gonna go.
:teaannoy: Is no one gonna tell me what British is-
:makoew: Ya'll are really doin that kinda shit in a melon patch?
:casualconfuse: Where we do that is NONE of your business!
:casualfine: Wait this is stupid- WHY THE FUCK IS THERE A TALKING MELON?
:casualfine: (They also look... weird...)
:teaneutral: Wouldn't be the weirdest thing that happened to us.
:makoew: Dudes, this is MY melon patch.

:makohappy: Anyways, I see you have a microphone. Wanna sing with me?
:teathink: Why DID you bring that here?...
:casualconfuse: You sing?
:mako: Yeah. It can get boring here sometimes, so I decided to pick up a hobby.
