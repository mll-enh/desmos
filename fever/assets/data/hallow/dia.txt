:teaworry: And... then what did you see?
:desmile: Darkness.
:desmile: Pitch black, everlasting darkness wherever I looked. Darker than the putrid womb of the ancient ones...
:desmile: It was so dark that closing my eyes made no difference...
:defrown: But... I knew there was something there... something... or SOMEONE watching me...
:teaworry: !
:defrown: Running out of options, I bumped into a wall... I realized this must have been the side of a building, so I followed alongside it.. inching closer and closer...
:defrown: No light. But, I knew I was somewhere familiar... then... I heard a noise...
:defrown: "Hey! Whos there!? Show yourself!" I yelled.
:defrown: And the next part... the next part... the next part... the next part...
:teaworry: Hey! F-fever?
:defrown: ...
:defrown: ...
:desmile: I was ATTACKED BY THE UNDEAD! ZOMBIES ATTACKING ME FROM ALL ANGLES, GUTS FLYING EVERYWHERE! BAHAHAHA!
:fuckoff:
:teaworry: !
:teatwo: YOU FUCKING-
:feverscared: OW.
:teatwo: YOU DESERVE THAT.
:feverannoyed: Ow, owww! Okay, sorry!  Fuck, I forgot you space bunnies are super strong...
:teatwo: And here I thought that you were ACTUALLY telling me something cool you did in the past...
:feverscared: I DID do that! I'm telling you babe, I was surrounded by brains, guts and more! I nearly lost my mind!
:teatwo: That implies that you were sane once. Forgive me if I uh, find that hard to believe.
:feversilly: I tell you, punchin' a hole in a zombie brain just isn't as satisfying as the real deal.
:teaneutral: Let's just go home. It's cold as FUCK in here.
:feverflirt: You're cold, huh? You know, my arms are feeling pretty warm and lonely right now...
:teatwo: Bruh.
:feverflirt: Ah, I love it when you say that~.
:sfx:oHShIT
:narrator: !
:feverscared: Huh?
:teatwo: Oh cool, what now?
:feverscared: I thought I heard something fall.
:teatwo: Oh no, I'm not falling for your shit this time, Fever.
:feverannoyed: No, I mean it!
:teaannoytwo: I said I'm done with this shit, Fe-
:song:hallowinst
:hallownorm: ...
:feverscaredjump: AH!
:teaworry: T-TAKI?!
:feverscared: Shouldn't you be at-
:feversmile: Oh wait, it's just a ghost... holding a painting of Taki?
:teaworry: A ghost?! There's GHOSTS in this town as well?..
:teaneutral: Actually, it's kinda cute.
:feverannoyed: Really. What DON'T you think is cute?
:teatwo: Those bunnies from like three weeks ago. I still have nightmares...
:feversmile: I didn't even notice its energy level. That means they're probably a pretty weak ghost.
:feverflirt: That or a pretty strong one. But I doubt that.
:hallownorm: ~
:teaneutral: Oh, what's up little guy?
:feversmile: It sure seems to love that painting...
:feversmile: 
:feverscared: AH-
