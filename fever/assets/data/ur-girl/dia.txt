:teasmile: Where the funk is this place at?
:feverconfuse: There's like, no signal here.
:teaannoy: I'm starving.
:feversilly: For my affection?
:teaannoytwo: For food, FEVER.
:fevertired: Right, right.
:teathink: Where are we, anyways?
:feverconfuse: I didn't think Fever Town spanned this far out.
:megasmile: Hey-
:feverconfuse: Huh?
:feverconfuse: I'm sorry, can we help you?
:feverfine: Wait, don't tell me-
:fevertired: You're also someone who wants to battle for my title.
:feverfine: I can't go FUNKING anywhere without this shit happening.
:megasmile: Oh, it's not the title of mayor that I'm after! 
:megaflex: Though thats not a bad bonus, haha.
:megasmile: My name is Mega, and I want *ya girl~.*
:teaannoy: Wha-??
:bg:megagay
:megahug: Do you mind if we take a picture together? I'd like to show Santa that you're all I want for Christmas~.
:feversmile:
:feverpointtwo: YOU CAN'T FOOL ME!
:megaconfused: HUH? WHAT-
:teaworry: What-
:feverscared: I knew it, they found me AGAIN! Hurry Tea, curse them out in your space language!
:teaannoy: You [VIOLENT ALIEN CURSING] with your [%#@#%^&^$%$@#$%^&*(%#] and you think you're so-
:megaconfused: No, you idiot! I meant that I'm here to take the girl besides you!
:feverconfuse: Huh?
:feversmile: Pfft.
:megasurprised: Yo? What's so funny?
:feversmile: You aren't serious, right?
:megaflex: I've been serious since the day my momma held me.
:megahug: And after I beat you by serenading your girl, we'll go do something incredibly romantic.
:teaneutral: So is singing how you guys settle shit on this planet?
:feversmile: Honestly, I've wondered that myself. It wasn't always like this.
:feversilly: Though if it were, I'd say I got pretty lucky with you.
:teablush: You're annoying.
:megaconfused: Uh-HELLO?
:megaconfused: STILL HERE.
:teaannoytwo: Don't fucking raise your voice at me, kay?
:megasurprised: R-right...
:feverconfuse: So lemme get this straight.
:feverconfuse: You wanna battle through singing.
:feverconfuse: And if you win, you get...her?
:megaflex: Fantastic plan, isn't it? I haven't found a single flaw with it yet.
:fevertired: Freakin' white people.
:megaballistic: WHAT-
:megaballistic: I-
:megaflex: No, no- I almost lost my cool. Gotta stay calm in front of the beautiful girl there.
:teasmile: ...
:feverpointtwo: What's in it for me?
:megascared: Huh???
:feverpointtwo: This has nothing to do with the Fever-Town-Challenge rule, so why on earth should I accept?
:megaflex: Well, if you win-
:megaflex: I'm sure you'll look extremely manly in front of your girl...
:megasmile: It'd be stupid to waste a chance at looking incredibly heroic in front of your girl.
:teaneutral: That's silly.
:teasmile: Singing is always fun, but this reasoning behind it is-
:feverpointtwo: Bet!
:teaannoytwo: WHAT.
:megamissed: Oh thank god you accepted.
:megaflex: I mean, of course you did! Here I was afraid you were gonna be a chicken in front of your girl.
:feverpointtwo: You can't phase me with your weak ass insults!
:feverpointtwo: (Shit. How did they know I'm super hungry?)
:teaannoy:
:fuckoff:
:teatwo: Ugh. Let me get the fucking speakers I guess.
