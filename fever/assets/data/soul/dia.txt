:demonwtftwo: (The room is spinning...)
:defrown: Damn! So, what's this? A pocket dimension?
:hallownorm: Hehe... so you're not entirely dumb...
:hallownorm: In here, I'm at my strongest...
:hallownorm: And you?... You're going to become my new host...
:defrown: (Shit. This place is sapping all of my strength. It's hard just to stand up.)
:defrown: (This was exactly its plan... I need to think of something.)
:desmile: So, you want my body, huh? Sure.
:demonpoint: I guess I can give it up, you've seemed to have earned it. No point in struggling if I'm caught with no way out.
:hallownorm: Kekeke...
:desmile: ...is what I would say.
:hallownorm: ?
:desmile: You've fallen into my trap. I've seperated you from the other ghosts.
:desmile: And while you're super strong now, I don't sense your power rising anymore...
:demonpoint: Which means, there's no one stopping me from beating the FUCK outta you now, IS THERE?
:hallowangry: GrRrRrR?...
:hallownorm: You're just... bluffing... I sense no strength from you whatsoever...
:desmile: Fine. I'll send you to hell myself, then.
:hallowenough: Rrr...
