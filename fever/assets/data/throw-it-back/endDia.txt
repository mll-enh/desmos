:hunnismile: You should feel proud, not many can hold that title to their name.
:feversilly: Huh? Hunni admitting that she lost? What kind of fucking universe is this?
:hunnimad: Don't get too cocky about one victory.
:hunnismile: Besides, no one's gonna know about this.

:hunnismile: Oh, she did.
:feverscared: What-
:hunnismile: She came along in the other limo. I think she changed her mind.
:teaworry: Uh oh- my covers blown.
:feverworry: Hey! Why would she-

:feverworry: Okay...
:impy: You've really softened up.
