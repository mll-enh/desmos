:defrown: (Shit. This is a lot different than just punching someone.)
:defrown: (Doesn't help that I just now realized that, they're not alone.)
:hallownorm: Nananana!~
:hallownorm:*Hallow claps their hands, making a song that sounds familiar to the face they're wearing.*
:defrown: (After throwing a few punches, I can also tell that there's one... three... maybe five other ghosts in the room...)
:defrown: They're all cheering you on, aren't they?
:hallownorm: Phhbt!~ Kakaka!
:defrown: So that's where you're getting your power from. You feed off of your lackeys.
:demonwtftwo: Shit, I guess I really am outnumbered.
:demonwtftwo: There's not much I can do here... I'm going to lose!...
:hallownorm: Hahahaha!~
:hallownorm: *Hallow begins to slowly inch closer towards Fever, clutching an empty painting in their hands...*
:demonwtf: BOO.
:hallowangry: KAH?!?!
:desmile: Hah. Did the big, bad, boss ghost get scared just by a little "boo?"
:desmile: And here I thought you'd actually live up to the face you're wearing.
:demonpoint: But I guess that, even a powerful spirit like you can sense fear. How reassuring~.
:hallowangry: GrRrRrRr...!
:hallowangry: ...
:hallownorm: Kekeke...
:defrown: (Stay calm, Fever. I know you want to beat them with your fists, just like how you've always handled life when things got rough.)
:paintingtea: *But things are different now.*
:hallownorm: Kekeke... ehehehe...
:slow:
:hallownorm: YOU... WILL... MEET... GOD...
:normal:
:defrown: ...
:defrown: Hang on, Tea. I'll finish this quickly.
