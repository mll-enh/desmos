:bf:I-It appears the old thing is broken...
:bf:...
:bf:Static, what an old friend of mine...
:bf:Within my mind of repeating deteriorating words... It is almost familiar...
:bf:Static...
:bf:I seem to be stuck in my head again...
:bf:...
:bf:Was it truly meant to be?
:bf:Whilst there was no good... or bad ending...
:bf:I seem quite content.
:bf:...
:bf:The sound of static.
:bf:It's calming, almost...
:bf:...
:bf:As confusion is continuously present...
:bf:And as strangers pass me by...
:bf:I can say I feel at peace within this faint and dissapearing mind.
:bf:Even if it is lonely...
:bf:Thank you.
