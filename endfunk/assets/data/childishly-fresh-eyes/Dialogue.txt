:dad:Damn... your condition is getting worse kid...
:bf:...
:dad:However, I must say I find it impressive that you've still got some singing talent in ya.
:bf:H-huh...? What makes you say that?
:dad:That little tune you sang earlier... was oddly beautiful.
:dad:Best way to put it would be... sentimental? 
:bf:Er... tune...? Oh right, that tune...
:dad:...
:dad:Heh. Ya know I'm pretty surprised that despite your condition you can still keep that naturally musical soul in ya.
:dad:On the other hand, I'm still that ex-rockstar the kids talk and mock about.
:dad:Kid, I don't got the guts you do-
:bf:-Why are you in my house?
:dad:...
:dad:I don't understand...
:bf:Y-you don't understand the fact you've broken into my house without permission...? 
:dad:...
:dad:I was allowed in, I don't mean no harm to ya...
:bf:.. Oh.
:bf:M-must've slipped my ol' mind... Please be at least a lil patient...
:dad:Right, my apologies.
:dad:...
:bf:...
:dad:But..
:dad:Why did this have to happen to you? So early, aren't you in your 30's now...?
:bf:... W-what?
:bf:...
:dad:Nevermind, I must be askin' too much. Should I... take my leave?
:bf:Ugh, as long as you don't interrupt my singing, I suppose you could stay a bit.
:bf:Company isn't so bad every once in a while.
:dad:...
:dad:Well? Go on, I'm rooting for ya.
