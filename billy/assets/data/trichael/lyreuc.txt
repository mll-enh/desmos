My creation, is it real, superstition, there's a feel, hypersensing details falling all between the lines, thinking back I wonder if I really don't have time.

Soon I'm Coming Home, a vessel all my own, to attain eternal life, into the light

[I tore off my face

I don't want it back

do not let me see it

it will fade to black]

I'm waiting,
Still breathing,
No longer worth deceiving

This flesh decaying but my,
heart's,
still,
bea-ting

This goes,
Far beyond you

Stirring,
Something untrue

Smoke may clear,
But I'm still here,
And always will be part
Of,
You

It's been a wild ride, I thank you for your time, peer deep into my eyes and see, I'm Joyous, to Be

but I'm
Still
Here,
and always will be
part
of
you
