The way you never cease to seize you dreams













-


Inspires me to be





Inspires me to be like you








And your determination 









Gets to me. 





-
Yeah, That's the part that makes me want to be with you














With the universe above,






-
You persist reaching





Into the endless






-
Into the endless string of time








While you chase the impossible,







I'll be there for you 'cause






I know till then you







I know till then you'll still be mine 







-

































































With the universe above,






-
You presist reaching





Into the endless







Into the endless string of time








While you chase the impossible







i'll be there for you 'cause






I KNOW


I know TILL THEN


I know till then YOU'LL BE 


I know till then you'll be MINE 

In the endless string of time





-
In the endless string of time!







With the universe above





With the universe ABOVE!!
